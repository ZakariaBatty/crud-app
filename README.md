# StudieBnb
StudieBnb is a functional booking application developed using the MERN stack and Tailwind CSS. Although my main focus was on functionality rather than UI design, I took the opportunity to learn and explore the capabilities of both MERN and Tailwind CSS. However, upon discovering Next.js and its new impressive features, I've decided to no longer work on the app. Instead, I will shift my focus on developing projects using Next.js.

# Technologies
* **M**ongoDB for the database management
* **E**xpress.js for handling server-side logic
* **R**eact for building the user interface
* **N**ode.js to enable server-side JavaScript execution

In addition to the MERN stack, the project also incorporates:

* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **useContext** for state management

# Key Features
* User authentication for secure login
* Listing and booking functionality for students to find and book accommodations
* Integration with MongoDB to store and retrieve data
* Utilization of useContext for state management

# Conclusion
The StudyBnb project provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack, specifically focusing on MongoDB and server-side JavaScript. By building a booking application tailored for students, I was able to learn about user authentication, data storage, and retrieval using MongoDB, and the implementation of front-end components and state management with React and useContext. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in full-stack web development and gained valuable insights into building practical and functional applications.
