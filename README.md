# StudyBnb
StudyBnb is a full stack booking application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a primary focus on practical web development. The project aims to gain experience in MongoDB and server-side JavaScript while exploring new technologies like useContext for state management and leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS for streamlined and responsive UI design.


# Technologies
* **M**ongoDB for the database management
* **E**xpress.js for handling server-side logic
* **R**eact for building the user interface
* **N**ode.js to enable server-side JavaScript execution

In addition to the MERN stack, the project also incorporates:

* **Tailwind CSS** for styling
* **useContext** for state management

# Key Features
* User authentication for secure login
* Listing and booking functionality for students to find and book accommodations
* Integration with MongoDB to store and retrieve data
* Utilization of useContext for state management

# Conclusion
The StudyBnb project provided an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack, specifically focusing on MongoDB and server-side JavaScript. By building a booking application tailored for students, I was able to learn about user authentication, data storage, and retrieval using MongoDB, and the implementation of front-end components and state management with React and useContext. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in full-stack web development and gained valuable insights into building practical and functional applications.
